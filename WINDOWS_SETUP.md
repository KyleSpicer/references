### What is Ghidra?
- Ghidra is a free and open-source software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). It helps analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

## Ncat
[Link to Ncat Install](https://serverspace.io/support/help/how-to-install-ncat-tool-on_windows-and-linux/)

### What is Ncat?
- Ncat is a versatile networking utility, part of the Nmap suite, designed for various network-related tasks. It can be used for debugging, scanning, transferring files, creating network servers, and much more.

## WSL 2
[Link to WSL 2 Install Guide](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)

### What is WSL 2 (Windows Subsytem for Linux 2)?
WSL2, or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows 11. It is an improvement over the original WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in several ways:

- Full Linux Kernel: WSL2 uses a real Linux kernel with Windows, which means it's capable of running all Linux software.

- Performance: WSL2 is significantly faster than WSL1, especially for file system-heavy operations.

- Compatibility: Since WSL2 runs a full Linux kernel, it offers much better compatibility for Linux applications, including support for Docker and other development tools that require full Linux kernel functionality.

- Resource Usage: WSL2 uses a lightweight VM, but it still allows you to control how much memory and CPU it can use, providing a balance between resource usage and performance.

WSL2 provides a way for developers to use a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for dual-booting or running a full virtual machine.

## Wireshark
[Link to Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

### What is Wireshark?
- Wireshark is an open-source network protocol analyzer and packet sniffer. It can be used to inspect and analyze network traffic.  

- It provides a wealth of information, including the source and destination IP address, protocol type, and even payload contents.

- Wireshark supports many network protocols, including Ethernet, TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and many more.

- Wireshark's ability to decode the conversations happening in your network can be a powerful tool for troubleshooting network problems, analyzing performance, or learning more about what's happening in a network. 

# Pip Installs
1. [Pip Version](#pip-version)
1. [Pre-Commit](#pre-commit)
1. [Poetry](#poetry)

### Ensure pip is in your $PATH
- After installing Python, I was still required to add the path to `pip` in addition to the `Python` path.
- Pip was located here (change to meet your specific case):
```
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3X\Scripts
```

### What is PIP?
- `pip` is the package installer for Python. It's a command-line tool that allows you to find, install, and manage Python packages (libraries and frameworks) from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other package repositories.

## Pip Version
```
python -m pip --version
```

## Pre-Commit
What is pre-commit?
- Is a tool used primarily for managing and maintaining pre-commit hooks in software projects. Pre-commit hooks are scripts or commands that run automatically before a commit is made in a version control system (like Git).

```
pip install pre-commit
```

## Poetry

```
pip install poetry
```

### What is Python Poetry?

Python Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects. It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and publishing Python packages. Here's a brief overview of its key features and functionality:

Dependency Management:
- Poetry uses a pyproject.toml file to specify project dependencies and their versions. This file is similar to a requirements.txt but more structured and versatile.

- It resolves and installs dependencies, ensuring that all required packages and their dependencies are compatible and correctly installed.

Environment Management:
- Poetry can create and manage virtual environments automatically, isolating project dependencies from your system Python or other projects.


Package Building and Publishing:
- Poetry simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages. It handles the packaging format and can publish packages to PyPI or other repositories with a single command.

Version Management:
- Poetry helps manage project versioning and adheres to semantic versioning principles, making it easier to handle releases and updates.

User-Friendly CLI:
- Poetry provides a command-line interface (CLI) that is intuitive and easy to use, with commands for adding, removing, and updating dependencies, running scripts, and managing environments.

## Create Daily Restart Task

### Purpose:
This Task will restart your system using a custom task.

Some benefits of restarting your computer daily include: 
- Improved Performance: Restarting clears the RAM, stops memory leaks, and closes unnecessary background processes, ensuring your computer runs smoothly.
- Stability: Restarting resets the system state, clearing minor glitches and bugs that can accumulate over time, leading to a more stable and reliable computer.
- Enhanced Security: Regularly applying security updates and closing open sessions reduces vulnerabilities and ensures a secure computing environment.
- Extended Hardware Lifespan: By not running components continuously, restarts can help reduce wear and tear, potentially extending the lifespan of your computer's hardware.
- Improved Network Performance: Restarting reinitializes network connections, which can resolve issues with connectivity and improve overall network performance.

### Steps to Creating Daily Restart Task:

1. Open task manager -> `Win + R`
1. Create Basic Task
1. Name Task: `Daily Restart` > Click `Next`
1. Set Trigger: Choose `Daily`, `Set desired time`, `Recur every set to 1` > Click Next
1. Set Action:  
    - Choose `Start a program` > Click Next
    - Program/script: `shutdown`
    - Add arguments (optional): `/r /f /t 0`
    - Click Next
1. Click `Finish` to set task.

### Argument Explanation:
- `/r`: This argument tells the shutdown command to restart the computer instead of shutting it down.

- `/f`: This forces running applications to close. It will forcefully terminate any running programs without warning the user, which ensures that the restart process isn't blocked by any open applications.

- `/t 0`: This sets the time delay before the restart to 0 seconds. The restart will occur immediately without any countdown or delay.
