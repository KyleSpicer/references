## WSL 2
[Link to WSL 2 Install Guide](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)

### What is WSL 2 (Windows Subsytem for Linux 2)?
WSL2, or Windows Subsystem for Linux 2, is a compatibility layer for running Linux binary executables natively on Windows 10 and Windows 11. It is an improvement over the original WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in several ways:

- Full Linux Kernel: WSL2 uses a real Linux kernel with Windows, which means it's capable of running all Linux software.

- Performance: WSL2 is significantly faster than WSL1, especially for file system-heavy operations.

- Compatibility: Since WSL2 runs a full Linux kernel, it offers much better compatibility for Linux applications, including support for Docker and other development tools that require full Linux kernel functionality.

- Resource Usage: WSL2 uses a lightweight VM, but it still allows you to control how much memory and CPU it can use, providing a balance between resource usage and performance.

WSL2 provides a way for developers to use a Linux environment directly on Windows without the need for dual-booting or running a full virtual machine.


# Pip Installs
1. [Pip Version](#pip-version)
1. [Pre-Commit](#pre-commit)
1. [Poetry](#poetry)

### Ensure pip is in your $PATH
- After installing Python, I was still required to add the path to `pip` in addition to the `Python` path.
- Pip was located here (change to meet your specific case):
```
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python3X\Scripts
```

### What is PIP?
- `pip` is the package installer for Python. It's a command-line tool that allows you to find, install, and manage Python packages (libraries and frameworks) from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other package repositories.

## Pip Version
```
python -m pip --version
```

## Pre-Commit
What is pre-commit?
- Is a tool used primarily for managing and maintaining pre-commit hooks in software projects. Pre-commit hooks are scripts or commands that run automatically before a commit is made in a version control system (like Git).

```
pip install pre-commit
```

## Poetry

```
pip install poetry
```

### What is Python Poetry?

Python Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python projects. It simplifies the process of creating, managing, and publishing Python packages. Here's a brief overview of its key features and functionality:

Dependency Management:
- Poetry uses a pyproject.toml file to specify project dependencies and their versions. This file is similar to a requirements.txt but more structured and versatile.

- It resolves and installs dependencies, ensuring that all required packages and their dependencies are compatible and correctly installed.

Environment Management:
- Poetry can create and manage virtual environments automatically, isolating project dependencies from your system Python or other projects.


Package Building and Publishing:
- Poetry simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages. It handles the packaging format and can publish packages to PyPI or other repositories with a single command.

Version Management:
- Poetry helps manage project versioning and adheres to semantic versioning principles, making it easier to handle releases and updates.

User-Friendly CLI:
- Poetry provides a command-line interface (CLI) that is intuitive and easy to use, with commands for adding, removing, and updating dependencies, running scripts, and managing environments.
